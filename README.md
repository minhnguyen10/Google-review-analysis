# Google Review Analysis (On going)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Google Reviews for a particular business using data obtained from serpAPI and insights from OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The project includes two main components:

Data collection and preprocessing: The project uses serpAPI to obtain Google Reviews data for a particular business. The data is then preprocessed and stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Analysis and Insights: The project performs a year-wise analysis of the ratings given in the reviews and uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate a summary of the reviews and identify key reasons why customers gave positive or negative feedback.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- serpAPI account (you can sign up for a free trial on the serpAPI website)
- OpenAI API key (you can sign up for a free trial on the OpenAI website)
Once you have these requirements installed, you can clone or download this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
To obtain Google Reviews data for a particular business, you will need to sign up for a serpAPI account and obtain an API key. You will also need to specify the business name and location in the serpAPI request to obtain the relevant reviews data.

The reviews data obtained from serpAPI is stored in a Pandas DataFrame and preprocessed to clean and standardize the data. This includes removing duplicates, converting dates to a uniform format, and extracting the rating and text of each review.

## Analysis and Insights
The project performs a year-wise analysis of the ratings given in the reviews to identify trends and patterns in customer feedback. The project also uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate a summary of the reviews and identify key reasons why customers gave positive or negative feedback.

The summary of the reviews generated by GPT-3 is a valuable insight into the overall customer experience and can be used by the business to make improvements and enhance the customer experience.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Google Reviews for a particular business and generates valuable insights into the customer experience. The results of this project can be used by businesses to make improvements and enhance the customer experience.
